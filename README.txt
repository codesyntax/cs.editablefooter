cs.editablefooter Package Readme

Overview
========

We've always wanted to edit the footer of Plone providing our
customers' contact info.

We've **always** customized both portal_footer.pt and
portal_colophon.pt in our Plone 2.5.x sites, but now we can hide them
easily hiding plone.footer and plone.colophon viewlets through
@@manage-viewlets or setting a viewlets.xml in an extension profile,
thanks to new viewlet infrastructure in Plone3.
